<p>"Why is money more valuable than the paper on which it is printed? Monetarists link the value of money to its supply and demand, believing the latter depends on the total value of the commodities it circulates. According to Prabhat Patnaik, this logic is flawed. In his view, in any nonbarter economy, the value we assign to money is determined independently of its supply and demand.</p>

<p>Through an original and provocative critique of monetarism, Patnaik advances a revolutionary understanding of macroeconomics that highlights the "propertyist" position of Karl Marx and John Maynard Keynes. Unlike the usual division between "classical" economists (e.g., David Ricardo and Marx) and the "marginalists" (e.g., Carl Menger, William Stanley Jevons, and Léon Walras), Patnaik places "monetarists," including Ricardo, on one side, while grouping propertyist writers like Marx, Keynes, and Rosa Luxemburg on the other. This second group subscribes to the idea that the value of money is given from outside the realm of supply and demand, therefore making money a form in which wealth is held. The fact that money is held as wealth in turn gives rise to the possibility of deficiency of aggregate demand under capitalism.</p>

<p>It is no accident that this possibility was highlighted by Marx and Keynes while going largely unrecognized by Ricardo and contemporary monetarists. At the same time, Patnaik points to a weakness in the Marx-Keynes traditionnamely, its lack of any satisfactory explanation of why the value of money, determined from outside the realm of supply and demand, remains relatively stable over long stretches of time. The answer to this question lies in the fact that capitalism is not a self-contained system but is born from a precapitalist setting with which it interacts and where it creates massive labor reserves that, in turn, impart stability to the value of money. Patnaik's theory of money, then, is also a theory of imperialism, and he concludes with a discussion of the contemporary international monetary system, which he terms the "oil-dollar" standard."<a href="https://cup.columbia.edu/book/the-value-of-money/9780231146760"> SOURCE</a></p>

<p>"What is a Genetically Modified Organism (GMO)?</p>

<p>A GMO is a plant-based organism, like a seed, that:</p>

<p>Has its genes (DNA) altered to act in a way that does not happen naturally and/or
Contains genes from another plant-based organism
GMOs are used to grow GM foods.</p>

<p>Since 1994, about 85 GM foods have been approved for sale in Canada. This includes GM foods grown in Canada and GM foods that have been imported from other countries. Only four main GM crops are currently grown in Canada including canola, soybean, corn and sugar beet. Most of these GM crops are exported to other countries.</p>

<p>GM crops have been developed to have certain benefits. GM foods may:</p>

<p>Resist damage due to weather, like frost or draught
Grow more easily in some environments (like dry soil conditions)
Produce more crop, helping to keep food prices lower
Ripen slower and last longer during shipping
Bruise less easily
Need less pesticides (like herbicides and insecticides)
Have less disease caused by insects or viruses
Have more of a certain nutrient like vitamin A found in Golden Rice, a GM rice crop used to fight malnutrition in developing countries."

<p>"The Internet will be in your contact lens. Imagine blinking, and then instantly going on line, accessing your home office, or home entertainment system anywhere or anytime. We will be able to download any movie, song, Web site, or piece of information off the Internet directly onto our Internet-enabled contact lenses. These lenses will also be able to identify people’s faces, translate their comments and provide subtitles, so that we will always know exactly with whom we are speaking and what they are saying in any language. We will live in a cross between “The Matrix” and real life. Tourists will love this, for example, since they will be able to see the glory of the Roman Empire resurrected in their contact lens as they walk among the ruins of Rome. Artists and architects will love it, as well, since they will be able to create great works of art by simply moving their hands in the air. People suffering from illnesses, like diabetes, will love it, too, because they will have immediate readouts of their heart rate, insulin levels, and other important conditions within their own bodies."<a href="http://nypost.com/2011/03/20/the-world-in-2100/"> SOURCE</a</p>
